# Which challenge should be used? Currently http-01 and dns-01 are supported
# dns-01 means: Let's encrypt will send a challenge with a text that it wants
# us to put into a TXT record of the DNS response for our domain.
# The hook script below will do that by calling an API of DuckDNS where our
# domain is registered. DuckDNS will add the challenge text to the TXT DNS 
# record and when Let's Encrypt does a DNS lookup (dig <domain> TXT) it will find
# the challenge text their and believe us that we are in control of the domain.
# Then it will issue a certificate for us.
CHALLENGETYPE="dns-01"

# Script to execute the DNS challenge and run after cert generation.
# The script calls a REST API of DuckDNS to add a challenge text from 
# Let's encrypt to the TXT records for our DNS domain. Let's encrypt will
# check that TXT record to check if we are in control of our domain.
# Only then will Let's Encypt issue a certificate.
